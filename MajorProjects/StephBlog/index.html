              Today I'm going to share with you some of my top fragrance picks for the summer. All of these oils are perfect for making bath bombs, candles, bubble bars and any other bath and body products you love.


1. Strawberry Shortcake- This fragrance oil is one of my favorites because its the perfect blend of fruity and sweet. This is also one of the first fragrance oils I got for making bath bombs and its still on of my favorites today.

2. Iced Pineapple- This one is perfect for any summer project you are making. This fragrance smells exactly like pineapple dole ice cream you can get at Disneyland and is so yummy.

3. Bouquet- This is a good one for those of you who like making all natural bath and body projects because this one is an essential oil. This is one of my favorite blends because its fruity and vanillay at the same time.

4. Salt Water Taffy- Do I even need to explain this one? This one smells like candy goodness and is so much fun to make things with.

5. Viva la Juicee-  This is the fragrance oil version of viva la juicy perfume and it is only $2.99 :o This scent is so much fun and perfect for summer.

6. Melon Mist- This one is a very light watermelon scent and is beautiful in making any bath and body products. This scent is light and refreshing.

7. PJ'S Blend- This is another essential oil blend that smells amazing! This one is also kid safe.

8. Jelly Beans- Once again this one smells like candy goodness. I don't know about you but I cant get enough candy fragrance oils.

9. Apple Mango Tango- This fragrance smells amazing and is very popular in the soap making community because its a very friendly scent and contains no vanilla. It also smells great.

10. French Market Flowers- Last but not least. Fresh market flowers. this one smells so good and has a sweet floral scent. perfect for those summer crafts.
